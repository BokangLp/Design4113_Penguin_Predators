# Design4113_Penguin_Predators
The objective of the project is to design a subsystem that detects predators in penguin colonies. The project is broken down into three major tasks:
1. The detection and classification of animals into target (predators) and non-target (non-predators) species.
2. The control of a deterrence subsystem which utilizes non-lethal methods to deter predators.
3. The communication with the user interfacing subsystem to communicate all the detection and deterrence data (for analysis purposes).

The hardware needed for this subsystem:
1. Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
2. ZeroCam Fisheye Module for Raspberry Pi Zero â€“ 170 Degree 5MP
3. PIR Sensor Detector Module
4. microSD Card (preferrably 32GB/16GB)
